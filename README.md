## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhyoprd/housing-price-prediction.git
   cd housing-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place the raw dataset in the `data/raw/` folder.
   - Run preprocessing:
     ```bash
     python src/preprocess.py
     ```

2. **Model Training**:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Prediction**:
   Use `predict.py` to make predictions on new data:
   ```bash
   python src/predict.py --input data/input.csv --output data/output.csv
   ```

4. **Run Flask API**:
   ```bash
   python app/app.py
   ```
   Access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🌐 Model Deployment

- **Option 1**: Deploy locally using Flask.
- **Option 2**: Containerize the app using Docker:
  ```bash
  docker build -t housing-price-prediction .
  docker run -p 5000:5000 housing-price-prediction
  ```

- **Option 3**: Deploy to the cloud (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
